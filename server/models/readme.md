All file that does'nt contain 'Model.' will be ignored.
For consistency, all file's name must follow the following structure => collectionName + 'Model.js'
All file must export the following object => {
  [capitalizedCollectionName + 'Model']: modelObject
  [capitalizedCollectionName]: mongoose model returned function
}

All file following these instruction will be automatically added to the main export (index.js)
